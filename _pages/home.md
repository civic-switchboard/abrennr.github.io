Civic Switchboard is an [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov_) supported effort that aims to develop the capacity of academic and public libraries in civic data ecosystems.

This project encourages partnerships between libraries and local data intermediaries; these partnerships will better serve data users, further democratize data, and support equitable access to information. The project will create a toolkit for libraries interested in expanding (or beginning) their role around civic information.
