The Civic Switchboard project design is based on two strong convictions. First, that cultivating a healthy local civic data ecosystem depends upon the coordinated efforts of a variety of data intermediaries. In other words, no single entity can effectively cover all of the necessary roles alone. To that end, our project team includes representation from a public library system (Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh), an academic library system (University of Pittsburgh), a regional open data portal (Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center, hosted by the University of Pittsburgh Center for Social and Urban Research), and a national membership organization of non-library civic data intermediaries (National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership), coordinated by the Urban Institute. Cultivating and strengthening similar partnerships in other regions is a core objective of this project.



Secondly, we believe that the importance of local context and the variety of local civic data landscapes mean that no single model can be made to fit every city or region. This can be seen, for example, across the network of National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership data intermediaries. Because each communityâ€™s civic data ecosystem is unique, the structure of local data intermediaries have evolved to take different shapes. Modelling at the national level must be done by capturing a wide variety of successful local practices. Although the prior work of the project team members serves as an example of successful library participation in our local civic data ecosystem, this project is deliberately designed to involve a broad and diverse cohort of regional participants whose experiences will inform its outputs.


Communities that wish to play a role in this project can also participate in two ways.


In Year 1, to broaden networks and expand resources, the project team will host workshops at two conferences: The National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership (May 2018) and the Digital Library Federation (October 2018). Stipends will be available for libraries and data intermediary organizations interested in participating in these workshops; a limited number of complimentary registration fees for the associated conferences will also be available.


In Year 2, the project will offer stipends to partnerships between libraries and local data intermediaries for field testing the toolkit.


We resolve to work in the open on this project, and commit to sharing information about our work as it evolves. We will regularly publish summaries of our progress on our project website, provide recaps of our major activity in a monthly email newsletter, draft periodic blog posts, and also engage with the broader community through social media.
