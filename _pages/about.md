In Year 1, to broaden networks and expand resources, the project team hosted workshops at two conferences: The [National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership](https://www.neighborhoodindicators.org) (May 2018) and the [Digital Library Federation](https://www.diglib.org) (October 2018). Stipends were available for libraries and data intermediary organizations interested in participating in these workshops; a limited number of complimentary registration fees for the associated conferences were also be available.

In Year 2, the project offered stipends to partnerships between libraries and local data intermediaries for field testing the toolkit.
