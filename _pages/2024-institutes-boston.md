More information is available from the [MBTA](https://www.mbta.com/destinations/logan-airport).

### Parking
The Copley branch of the Boston Public Library is well-serviced by public transit, including the green line, the orange line, the commuter rail, and the bus system. Parking is available at multiple hotels and garages nearby, including the Copley Place Central Garage at [100 Huntington](https://www.simon.com/mall/copley-place/stream/parking-at-copley-place-6134933).

### Food
Inside the library, Newsfeed Cafe provides coffee, snack, and breakfast/lunch options. The Flour by Back Bay Station has great veggie and vegan-friendly breakfast/lunch choices as well. Boylston Street is home to lots of fast-casual chains, including Chipotle and Sweetgreen. Newbury Street, just a block away from BPL, is one of Boston’s most popular shopping and restaurant districts with many options for sit-down dining or quick eats (pizza at Dirty Water Dough Company). Chinatown, home to lots of Chinese and Thai cuisine, is a 15-minute walk from the library. South Street Diner - perhaps the last all-day-and-night diner in the city - is a reliable greasy spoon for night owls.
