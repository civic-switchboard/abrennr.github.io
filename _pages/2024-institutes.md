Civic data describes a broad range of information related to community life and the decision-making and policies that affect people and places; it can include not only data produced by governmental organizations, but also non-profits, civic institutions (like libraries!), and other community-based organizations.

Through our _Civic Data Literacy for Libraries: A Civic Switchboard Institute_ project, we will host 
six regional and one online institutes in 2024 for library workers interested in serving as intermediaries 
between community members and civic data and developing civic data roles for their libraries.

Each Institute will bring together 20 library workers who are currently working with civic data or who are interested in developing new civic data roles and projects in their libraries.
