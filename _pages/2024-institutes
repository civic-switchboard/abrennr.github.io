Through our Civic Data Literacy for Libraries: A Civic Switchboard Institute project, we will host 
six regional and one online institutes for library workers interested in serving as intermediaries 
between community members and civic data and developing civic data roles for their libraries.

## Institute Schedule

* April 18-19, 2024 : Pittsburgh, PA Institute
* May 13-14, 2024: Chapel Hill, NC Institute
* June 27-28, 2024: Boston, MA Institute
* July 11-12, 2024: Portland, OR Institute
* August 1-2, 2024: South Bend, IN Institute
* October 17-18, 2024: Houston, TX Institute
* November 7 and 14, 2024: Online Institute


There are several goals for the Civic Switchboard Institutes:

* To expand a community of practice focused on libraries and civic data and connect regional library workers;
* To support participants in understanding their civic data ecosystem and potential roles for their libraries;
* To connect participants with exemplars of library civic data intermediary work by featuring the work of host sites;
* To foster critical data literacies through engagement with topics in civic data that speak to power, social justice, and responsible data practices to mitigate harms;
* And refine our previously designed educational materials for a library audience.

We are pleased to be working with incredible regional partners who will host the 2-day Institutes in 2024:

* Alex Chassanoff (University of North Carolina Chapel Hill) for a Chapel Hill, NC workshop
* The Data Services at Fondren Library at Rice University for a Houston, TX workshop;
* Matthew Sisk (The University of Notre Dame) for a South Bend, IN workshop;
* Nancee Hunter (Portland State University) for a Portland, OR workshop;
* Garrett Dash Nelson and Ian Spangler (Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library) for a Boston, MA workshop.
* Pittsburgh, PA, the location of the Civic Switchboard team, will also serve as a workshop site, and we will offer one entirely online workshop.
